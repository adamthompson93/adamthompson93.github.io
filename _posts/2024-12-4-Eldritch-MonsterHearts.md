title: Eldritch Knowledge in Monsterhearts

I recently volunteered to take over the reigns of a campaign of Monsterhearts I have been playing with a group of friends for the last couple years now. Taking over an existing setting from another DM is always a bit of a challenge (especially when said DM will be playing in your game). In preparation I've been trying to do some plotting that will keep things consistent where we've already established Lore and point the game's focus in a new direction. Monsterhearts is a game where the characters' playbooks will often have moves that necessarily establish things about the world. One of the most common examples is the Gang advancement where in taking it the player is either creating a group of new NPCs or changing the trajectory of some existing ones, and something like that should have consequences in order to keep things narratively satisfying
