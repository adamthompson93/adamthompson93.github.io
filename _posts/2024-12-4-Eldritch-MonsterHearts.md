title: Eldritch Knowledge in Monsterhearts

I recently volunteered to take over the reigns of a campaign of Monsterhearts I have been playing with a group of friends for the last couple years now. Taking over an existing setting from another DM is always a bit of a challenge (especially when said DM will be playing in your game). In preparation I've been trying to do some plotting that will keep things consistent where we've already established Lore and point the game's focus in a new direction. Monsterhearts is a game where the characters' playbooks will often have moves that necessarily establish things about the world. Its a very fun back and forth where sometimes when a player levels up they can choose to take a move that will take the narrative in a totally new direction. One of the most common examples is the Gang advancement where in taking it the player is either creating a group of new NPCs or changing the trajectory of some existing ones, and something like that should have consequences/world impact in order to keep things narratively satisfying. Now the scope of effect of the Gang move is pretty local in nature, but a different example is just by choosing a skin you make the circumstances that created that sort of monster a thing that needs to be considered by the game world. 


Anyways. I want to add some Eldritch goodness to the world because we haven't had any and its cool. Monsterhearts is at its core about being a fun sexy problematic teen drama. Much like a teen drama, it can be a game about investigating, so that part I'm not too worried about. At most I might be making some tweaks to Gaze into the Abyss move so that it interacts with whatever it is I piece together here.

Here's the standard Gaze into the Abyss text:

```
Gaze Into the Abyss:
When you gaze into the abyss, name what youâ€™re looking for and roll with Dark. 
On a 10 up, the abyss shows you lucid visions, and you take 1 Forward to addressing them. 
On a 7-9, the abyss shows you confusing and alarming visions, but you get your answer nonetheless.
```


A written it can already pretty easily be bent in our desired direction, so lets just leave it for now and move on to the next part of the concept
