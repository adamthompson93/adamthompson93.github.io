title: Eldritch Knowledge in Monsterhearts
date: 2024-12-4

I recently volunteered to take over the reigns of a campaign of Monsterhearts I have been playing with a group of friends for the last couple years now. Taking over an existing setting from another DM is always a bit of a challenge (especially when said DM will be playing in your game). In preparation I've been trying to do some plotting that will keep things consistent where we've already established Lore and point the game's focus in a new direction. Monsterhearts is a game where the characters' playbooks will often have moves that necessarily establish things about the world. Its a very fun back and forth where sometimes when a player levels up they can choose to take a move that will take the narrative in a totally new direction. One of the most common examples is the Gang advancement where in taking it the player is either creating a group of new NPCs or changing the trajectory of some existing ones, and something like that should have consequences/world impact in order to keep things narratively satisfying. Now the scope of effect of the Gang move is pretty local in nature, but a different example is just by choosing a skin you make the circumstances that created that sort of monster a thing that needs to be considered by the game world. 


Anyways. I want to add some Eldritch goodness to the world because we haven't had any and its cool. Monsterhearts at its core about being a fun, sexy, problematic, teen drama. Much like a teen drama, it can be a game about investigating, so that part I'm not too worried about. There are two primary moves I would consider relevant to investigating in MH.


```
Gaze Into the Abyss
When you gaze into the abyss, name what you’re looking for and roll with Dark. 
• On a 10 up, the abyss shows you lucid visions, and you take 1 Forward to addressing 
them. 
• On a 7-9, the abyss shows you confusing and alarming visions, but you get your answer nonetheless.

Keep your Cool
When you keep your cool and act despite fear, name what you’re afraid of and 
roll with Cold. 
• On a 10 up, you keep your cool and gain insight: ask the MC a question about the situation and take 1 Forward to acting on that information. 
• On a 7-9,the MC will tell you how your actions would leave you vulnerable, and you can
choose to back down or go through with it.
```

One thing we can consider including in Gaze into the Abyss is a consequence for rolling over a 12.

There's also the matter of combat

A written these can already pretty easily be bent in our desired direction, so lets just leave them for now and move on to the next part of the concept. 
I am now going to start sifting through the PbtA-ish game tremulus which is about the exact sort of stuff that I want to do but with less sexy monsters and fucking. 

There's a trust mechanic which looks interesting. 

```
What Trust Means
-3 Wouldn’t sleep in the same house as them.
-2 Wouldn’t turn your back on them.
-1 Find them shifty.
0 Casual acquaintance. No real opinion positive or negative.
+1 A good friend, trustworthy.
+2 Close friend, trust with important personal matters.
+3 Inner circle, trust with your life.

Group Dynamics
You may increase your Trust in someone by 1 at the end of each session. If
you do, you must reduce your Trust in someone else by 1 as well. Whenever
you survive a story arc (whether you succeed or fail), you increase your
Trust in a fellow survivor by 1 (without reducing your Trust elsewhere) or
gain 1 Lore. This ebb and flow of Trust should be reflected in the narrative.

Secrets
When your Trust in someone will exceed +3/-3, the player must tell you a
secret truth about their character, and you gain a point of Lore. Reset Trust
to +1, 0, or -1 based upon what you learn (as you view them a bit differently
now). You’re under no obligation to keep their secret. If you ever reveal it,
and the confider finds out, they reduce their Trust in you by one.
```
