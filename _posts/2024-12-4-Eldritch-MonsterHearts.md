title: Eldritch Knowledge in Monsterhearts
date: 2024-12-4

I recently volunteered to take over the reigns of a campaign of Monsterhearts (heretofore MH) I have been playing with a group of friends for the last couple years now. Taking over an existing setting from another DM is always a bit of a challenge (especially when said DM will be playing in your game). In preparation I've been trying to do some plotting that will keep things consistent where we've already established Lore and point the game's focus in a new direction. MH is a game where the characters' playbooks will often have moves that necessarily establish things about the world. Its a very fun back and forth where sometimes when a player levels up they can choose to take a move that will take the narrative in a totally new direction. One of the most common examples is the Gang advancement where in taking it the player is either creating a group of new NPCs or changing the trajectory of some existing ones, and something like that should have consequences/world impact in order to keep things narratively satisfying. Now the scope of effect of the Gang move is pretty local in nature, but a different example is just by choosing a skin you make the circumstances that created that sort of monster a thing that needs to be considered by the game world. 

Anyways. I want to add some Eldritch goodness to the world because we haven't had any and its cool. MH at its core about being a fun, sexy, problematic, teen drama. Much like a teen drama, it can be a game about investigating, so that part I'm not too worried about. There are two primary moves I would consider relevant to investigating in MH.

```
Gaze Into the Abyss
When you gaze into the abyss, name what you’re looking for and roll with Dark. 
• On a 10 up, the abyss shows you lucid visions, and you take 1 Forward to addressing 
them. 
• On a 7-9, the abyss shows you confusing and alarming visions, but you get your answer nonetheless.

Keep your Cool
When you keep your cool and act despite fear, name what you’re afraid of and 
roll with Cold. 
• On a 10 up, you keep your cool and gain insight: ask the MC a question about the situation and take 1 Forward to acting on that information. 
• On a 7-9,the MC will tell you how your actions would leave you vulnerable, and you can
choose to back down or go through with it.
```

One thing we can consider including that plays into the idea of certain kinds of knowledge being dangerous is by adding a "rolling too high" mechanic into Gaze into the Abyss (partially taking inspiration from the Can't Lose supplement).  It's still a success but depending on what one is looking into it will draw unnecessary attention, give the player Shock. or even impart a Psychological Wound (We'll get to that). 

What's Shock? Well. We're going to need some sort of a psychological harm track. We're going to call it Shock because we're stealing it from tremulus. But we're also going to lean on Pressure from Can't Lose in how we implement it.
First how else can we gain shock?

There's Pressure Point situations from Can't Lose:
```
Pressure Point
When intense pressure is put on the body or
psyche of teenage athletes, each affected character
has a choice to make:
 internalize the expectations and gain a Pressure, or
 reject the expectations and lose a Pressure.
```

But only the first half really neatly translates. 

```
When exposed to something that dramatically impacts or undermines a their understanding of reality,  
each affected character must internalize the information and gain a Shock.
```

Time to pivot. Let's look at tremulus again.

```
When a character sees something terrifying or potentially startling (and
thus, could reasonably cause shock), he must immediately Act Under
Pressure You can refer to this as a sanity check. It is a roll +reason
(unless they have moves that indicate otherwise).
On a 10+, they take 1 less shock and may act normally.
On a 7-9, they take 1 less shock but are -1forward.
On a miss, they take full shock and are either -1ongoing (for the scene)
or the Keeper holds one (Keeper’s choice).
```

Okay so this sounds like we could combine what we got from Pressure Points, add this in, and use Keep Your Cool to make...

```
When a character is exposed to something that dramatically impacts or undermines a their understanding of reality, or something they would find genuinely terrifying , must immediately Act Under
Pressure You can refer to this as a sanity check. It is a roll +reason
(unless they have moves that indicate otherwise).
On a 10+, they take 1 less shock and may act normally.
On a 7-9, they take 1 less shock but are -1forward.
On a miss, they take full shock and are either -1ongoing (for the scene)
or the Keeper holds one (Keeper’s choice).
```

Filling up the Shock track is going to lead to a Skirting Death type move. 

```
Snap
When you gain a sixth Shock, you Snap. Choose one:
 You become your Darkest Self, and ???
 You become catatonic, losing all your Shock and
all the Strings you have on others.
```


There's also the matter of combat. Things need to feel a bit more dangerous and also more dynamic. Working as a team should feel mechanically easier than it is in base MH.
