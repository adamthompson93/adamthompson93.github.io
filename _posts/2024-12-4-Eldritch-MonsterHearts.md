title: Eldritch Horror in Monsterhearts (Part 1)
date: 2024-12-4
---
I recently volunteered to take over the reigns of a campaign of Monsterhearts (heretofore MH) I have been playing with a group of friends for the last couple years now. Taking over an existing setting from another DM is always a bit of a challenge (especially when said DM will be playing in your game). In preparation I've been trying to do some plotting that will keep things consistent where we've already established Lore and point the game's focus in a new direction. MH is a game where the characters' playbooks will often have moves that necessarily establish things about the world. Its a very fun back and forth where sometimes when a player levels up they can choose to take a move that will take the narrative in a totally new direction. One of the most common examples is the Gang advancement where in taking it the player is either creating a group of new NPCs or changing the trajectory of some existing ones, and something like that should have consequences/world impact in order to keep things narratively satisfying. Now the scope of effect of the Gang move is pretty local in nature, but a different example is just by choosing a skin you make the circumstances that created that sort of monster a thing that needs to be considered by the game world. 

Anyways. I want to add some Eldritch goodness to the world because we haven't had any and its cool. MH at its core about being a fun, sexy, problematic, teen drama. Much like a teen drama, it can be a game about investigating, so that part I'm not too worried about. There are two primary moves I would consider relevant to investigating in MH.

```
Gaze Into the Abyss
When you gaze into the abyss, name what you’re looking for and roll with Dark. 
• On a 10 up, the abyss shows you lucid visions, and you take 1 Forward to addressing 
them. 
• On a 7-9, the abyss shows you confusing and alarming visions, but you get your answer nonetheless.

Keep your Cool
When you keep your cool and act despite fear, name what you’re afraid of and 
roll with Cold. 
• On a 10 up, you keep your cool and gain insight: ask the MC a question about the situation and take 1 Forward to acting on that information. 
• On a 7-9,the MC will tell you how your actions would leave you vulnerable, and you can choose to back down or go through with it.
```

One thing we can consider including that plays into the idea of certain kinds of knowledge being dangerous is by adding a "rolling too high" mechanic into Gaze into the Abyss (partially taking inspiration from the Can't Lose supplement).  It's still a success but depending on what one is looking into it will draw unnecessary attention, give the player Shock. or even impart a Psychological Wound (We'll get to that).  

`On a 13+ you get a full success but the abyss looks back, something unlucky happens.`

What's Shock? Well. We're going to need some sort of a psychological harm track. We're going to call it Shock because we're stealing it from tremulus. But we're also going to lean on Pressure from Can't Lose in how we implement it.
First how else can we gain shock?

There's Pressure Point situations from Can't Lose:
```
Pressure Point
When intense pressure is put on the body or
psyche of teenage athletes, each affected character
has a choice to make:
 internalize the expectations and gain a Pressure, or
 reject the expectations and lose a Pressure.
```

But only the first half really neatly translates. 

```
When exposed to something that dramatically impacts or undermines a their understanding of reality,  
each affected character must internalize the information and gain a Shock.
```

Time to pivot. Let's look at tremulus again.

```
When a character sees something terrifying or potentially startling (and
thus, could reasonably cause shock), he must immediately Act Under
Pressure You can refer to this as a sanity check. It is a roll +reason
(unless they have moves that indicate otherwise).
On a 10+, they take 1 less shock and may act normally.
On a 7-9, they take 1 less shock but are -1forward.
On a miss, they take full shock and are either -1ongoing (for the scene)
or the Keeper holds one (Keeper’s choice).
```

Okay so this sounds like we could combine what we got from Pressure Points, add this in, and use Keep Your Cool to make...

```
When a character is exposed to something that undermines a their understanding of reality or something genuinely terrifying, they must immediately roll to Keep their Cool. You can refer to this as a sanity check. It is a roll + Cold (unless they have moves that indicate otherwise).
• On a 10+, they take 1 less shock and may act normally.
• On a 7-9, they take 1 less shock but are -1 forward.
• On a miss, they take full shock and are either -1 ongoing (for the scene) or the MC holds one (MC’s choice).
```

That feels a lot cleaner. Now how do we deal with shock? Harm in MH is healed via the Healing move:

```
Healing
When you take time to tend to your wounds, once per session you may heal 1 Harm. If someone else is there with you, tending to your wounds delicately and intimately – and perhaps with erotic subtext –
you may heal an additional 1 Harm.
```

Note that there is no rolling, only a mechanical incentive to include other characters in the moment when you heal. This is compelling for obvious reasons and fits excellently into MHs vibe. 
But it doesn't quite work for healing shock, I think. And the tremulus shock healing also is totally off vibe. 

```
To treat a character with three or more shock, roll +stock spent. 
On a 7+, the subject stabilizes (restore Sanity to second segment), but the Keeper chooses 1 (on a 10+) or 2 (on a 7–9): 
• They need to be physically restrained before you can move them. 
• Even sedated, they fight you; you’re Acting Under Pressure. 
• They’ll be in and out of consciousness for 24 hours. 
• Stabilizing them eats up your stock; spend 1 stock more. 
• They’ll be bedridden, out of action, for at least a week. 
• They’ll need constant monitoring and care for 36 hours. On 6 or less, they take 1 shock instead.
```

So where do we go from here? Well MH is about teen drama, so we want to create more of those dramatic, intimate moments. Moments of shared vulnerability, offering a hand, and even rejecting someones help are all good dramatic moments in a teen drama.

```
Processing
When you take the time to process your feelings, once per session you may heal 1 Shock. If someone else is there with you, and they have a 
String on you, they may offer to Hold Hands. If instead you reject their help, immediately roll to Shut Them Down.

Hold Hands
When you bring your own feelings to bear in a moment of shared emotional vulnerability with someone Processing, roll with Hot.
• On a 10+ you both heal for 1 Shock.
• On a 7-9, they heal for 1 Shock.
• On a 6, it all goes horribly wrong. You both take 1 Shock.
```

I also think we want a way for the players to be able to leverage their level of Shock. Something like the Vent Pressure move from Can't Lose.

```
Vent Pressure
When the pressure of high school sports pushes
you to act recklessly and impulsively, and a dicerolling
move is triggered, you can choose to Vent
Pressure. If you do, treat the roll as a sports roll.
```

But I don't think leaning on our trauma to solve problems reducing Shock makes a whole lot of sense. Plus, rolling +Shock has the potential to be very powerful. So we need some guaranteed consequences for using the move as well as a potential for *problems* at higher levels of Shock. 

```
Confront the Darkness
When the need to know drives you towards madness, or when the need to fight back overcomes your sense of self preservation, 
and a dice-rolling move is triggered, you can choose to Confront the Darkness. If you do, the move's roll becomes +Shock.
A 13+ is a full success, but the character pushed too far and it comes with serious consequences.
Gain a Shock.
```

Filling up the Shock track is going to lead to a Skirting Death type move but we . 

```
Snap
When you gain a sixth Shock, you Snap. For each option you choose (minimum 1), lose 3 Shock:
• You become your Darkest Self.
• You suffer a bout of Temporary Madness.
• Lose all the Strings you have on others.
```

Okay so now to engage with "What even is Temporary Madness?"

There's also the matter of combat. Things need to feel a bit more dangerous and also more dynamic. Working as a team should feel mechanically easier than it is in base MH.
